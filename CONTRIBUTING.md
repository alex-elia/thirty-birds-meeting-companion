# Contributing to Thirty Birds Meeting Companion

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Ways to Contribute

- **Use the tool** (once available) and report issues or improvements.
- **Improve docs**: clarify the problem statement, specs, or architecture.
- **Help with implementation**: frontend, backend, or AI integration.

## Development Workflow (Draft)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `feat/my-feature`.
3. Make your changes with tests (where applicable).
4. Open a Pull Request describing:
   - The problem you are solving.
   - The approach you took.
   - Any limitations or follow-up ideas.

We will flesh out detailed guidelines (coding style, testing strategy, etc.) once the initial tech stack is in place.

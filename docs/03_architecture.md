# Architecture – Thirty Birds Meeting Companion

_This document will evolve alongside implementation. Initial ideas and options only._

## Draft Principles

- **In-room first**: Optimize for a single physical room with a shared display and microphone.
- **Offline-capable core**: Timers, agenda, and roundtable logic must work without network.
- **Pluggable AI**: Transcription and LLM-based features are optional modules.

(Architecture options and diagrams to be added once the tech stack is finalized.)
